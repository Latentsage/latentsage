J,

To begin, welcome to VSO.

Eager for more agents, we have reviewed your application, which you will not remember sending, and have found you up to our very high standards.

Soon, you will be beginning your mission. But before I can provide information, I must inform you of some ground rules:
- Tell no one about the mission, not even your partner. We can't know who might be listening
- Important mission information will be communicated to you through codes, deposited in your environment
- Note: Simply enter the code into the box below, and it will be decrypted into your next mission memo

Good luck J.
