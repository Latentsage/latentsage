J,

Congratulations on passing your first test.

The subject of your mission is a VSO agent known only as {% include radv.html %}. Over the past six months, {% include radv.html %}'s actions have become more and more erratic. The most recent communication we've received from her was two weeks ago.

We fear she's gone rogue.

Your next encoded message will be in a remote location.
