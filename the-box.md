J,

Oh, how delightful, you figured it out! You must be such a clever new agent.

Well, how should our grand game begin? I'd hate for you to think me Cold. Should we make use of some of the contents? Your skin is ever so Creamy and some of the items in here are so Chunky.

But I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself.

You'll never stop me you know. Try as you might, I'm just too quick. Too smart for you.

But it's sooo adorable watching you try.

Good luck.

Volatilely,
