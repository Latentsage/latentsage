J,

You've done it. VSO cannot thank you enough for the work you have done for us today.

I can't thank you enough.

{% include radv.html %} had me hanging over a lasersnake, just about to be lasereaten, when you hacked into her off grid server and released me.

After a short laserbattle the snake was subdued (to be released in the laserwild at a later date), but unfortunately {% include radv.html %} got away.

We must be ever vigilant J, for we do not know when she might strike next.

Until then, excellent work.
