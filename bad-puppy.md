Clumsiest Puppy,

Bad puppy. You've made such a mess of things. I'd almost think you didn't want to join me as my loyal pet, but of course that's impossible.

Oh well, I suppose it wouldn't be as much fun if you weren't such a clever puppy.

Don't think this is the end though. I'll never be very far away.

And just when you least expect it, I'll be back.

To take what's mine.

Until then.


Vauntingly,
\-V
