Dearest Puppy,

I've captured {% include boringv.html %}.

It's been fun playing together puppy, but try as you might to puzzle out her location, you'll never find her in time.

Guess you'll just have to box up your desk and leave the agency in shame.

Don't worry little puppy, you'll always have a spot by my side :3

Victoriously,
\- V
